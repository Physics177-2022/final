    "For the text description, you should feel free to expand on your midterm mini-project. Note that the final **must** include a worked example in Python. For examples of how to do this, look back to the Jupyter notebooks accompanying each lecture from the course. I'd strongly encourage you to not just plot your results at the end, but also to show intermediate results along the way. Here's a (very in depth!) [example](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/05.07-support-vector-machines.html) using [support vector machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support_vector_machine) for classification, to show a different style of organization.\n",
